# INOperator :

In Python, the in operator determines whether a given value is a constituent element of a sequence such as a string, array, list, or tuple. When used in a condition, the statement returns a Boolean result of True or False. The statement returns True if the specified value is found within the sequence

# NOT Operator :

It is used to get the negation of a value, i.e. it allows us to invert the truth value of a given boolean expression. This operator can be applied in boolean situations like if statements and while loops. It also functions in non-Boolean settings, enabling you to reverse the variablesâ€™ truth values.

The below table shows the outcomes for some input values when the not the operator is applied to them.

Input	Output
True	False
False	True
not is a unary operator which means it takes only one input value. It can be used with any boolean expression or Python object.
