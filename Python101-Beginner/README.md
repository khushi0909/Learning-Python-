# 1)Executing Python Code 


suppose 

print("helloworld hahahahahah ")

is written in vs code or any other editor 

// Through Terminal Method :
    there you need to type 
    there you need to type 
To run the code and see ,you need to open the terminal (terminal can be any ex vs code or cmd etc )
,there you need to type 

    python filename
    ex:python helloworld.py

you will get to see the result in terminal as 


      helloworld hahahahahah


# 2)Basic Arithmetic 

in terminal you need to type the python first (path should be correct ex:/Desktop or whereever your file is etc .)

then you willsee the version name as follows 
        
        Python 3.11.3 (tags/v3.11.3:f3909b8, Apr  4 2023, 23:49:59) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

after this you can write your basic arithmetic commands and hit enter ,you will be able to see the result ,examples ->

                >>> 5 + 5
                10
                >>> 99-11
                88
                >>> 4 *4
                16
                >>> 100/25
                4.0
                >>> 4**4            // 4 power 4
                256


suppose you typed something wrong and error came up as follows 
              
                >>> ddddd
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
            NameError: name 'ddddd' is not defined

so ,in this case you can press ctrl+L and you  can continue further 

            >>> ^L
            >>>
