lst = ["one","two","three",'four','five']
print(lst[2])
print(lst[0:3])
print(lst[2::])
print(lst[-1])                  # * without colon it is called as indexing and with colon it is called as slicing 
print(lst[-1::])

# answer is : three
# ['one', 'two', 'three']
# ['three', 'four', 'five']
# five
#['five']
# so this is indexing in array/lists it starts counting item with 0,1,2 and we can print specific item we want
# apart from lists ,strings are also iterabels

course = "Python 101"
print(course[5])

# answer is : n
